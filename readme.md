## Instruction on how to use the application
- First, press login without having to enter credentials, as that is something simple and was just there for future promising additions.
- Then you can see a new screen with all of the zones in the air.
- On the checkpoint menu, press add and start making checkpoints on the zones, one for each zone is mandatory except the last and smallest one. That area is for planes.
- Then on the airplane menu click on add and select a starting point from the outer ring. You can hit the play button and the airplane will start moving to its airstrip. You can add as many airplanes and checkpoints as wanted. The algorithm will calculate the shortest path to the airstrip by itself.
